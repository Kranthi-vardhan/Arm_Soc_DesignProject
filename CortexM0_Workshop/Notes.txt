Physical Domain, Structural, Behaviour domain
HDL hardware description languages,

Standar reference IEEE 1364-2001,
Resources: Verlog HDL - samir,
JBasker
Sutherland and Don mills

HDL are used
is concurrent description language, executes parallley
RTL - Resister- transister language
NetList - gate level structure

synthesis tool translate HDL to Gate level netlist,
Then it goes under processes, 
FPGA,PAL,ASIC(Customs IC)

Example:
Magnitude comparitor.
actuall way is to compute combinational circuit suing the input and out puts, which is 3-bit vs 3-bit = 

Module: Design block,
Has ports- input, output
Module name, 
Port declaration Terminal ports,
No module inside other moduakes

ends with endmodule


4 logic values
0, 1, z, x;
